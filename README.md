Repo contains all the project files for the modules of this course

# Contents

# Module 1
Create a program that reads a list of Integer numbers from a file named data.txt (create your own file with about 16 numbers - no repetitions and one number per line);
Store those numbers into an array a and sort it - a.sort();
Use the linked list and node classes seen in class to store the ordered elements of a into a LinkedList structure L;
Ask the user a Integer value x;
Look for the position to insert x in L;
If the value x is already in L, remove it;
If it is not, insert x in the appropriated position so L remains sorted;

# Module 2
Create a program that reads a list of people (use the class Person seem in class) from a file named people.csv (create your own file with about 15 fictional people - each person 4 information: nickname, name, family, age).
Store those people in a stack (use any stack implementation you want among the ones presented in class). Ask repeatedly the user integer numbers from 1 to 4, and according to the user informed number pop this amount of people, printing the name of the one remaining in the top of the stack. For example, if the user enters 2, removes two people from the stack and print the "third" remaining in the stack
The program stops as the stack becomes empty.

# Module 3
Create a program that reads a list of numbers from a text file named ‚Äúnumbers.txt‚Äù and create a binary tree ordered as the example presented in class.
From the tree structure you have created, create and print an adjacency matrix that represents the graph equivalent to the tree, considering an edge from the node to its child with weight being the absolute value of the difference between the numbers of the nodes, using the preorder of the nodes.

# Module 4
Create an algorithm to solve each problem and implement your algorithm in Python code as a function with the indicated input parameters and return value.  Create a driver/main block of code that initializes the input parameters and makes the function call inside a print statement to print out the value returned by the function call.
          1. Find the number of entries in an array of integers that are divisible by a given integer. Your function should have two input parameters ‚Äì an array of integers and a positive integer ‚Äì and should return an integer indicating the count using a return statement.
          2. Given an array of real numbers, without sorting the array, find the smallest gap between all pairs of elements (for an array A, the absolute value of the difference between elements ùê¥[i] and ùê¥[ùëó]). Your function should have one input parameter ‚Äì an array of numbers ‚Äì and should return a non-negative number indicating the smallest gap using a return statement.
          3. Given an integer n>=2 and two nxn matrices A and B of real numbers, find the product AB of the matrices. Your function should have three input parameters ‚Äì a positive integer n and two nxn matrices of numbers‚Äì and should return the nxn product matrix using a return statement.

# Module 5
Brute Force Algorithms
1. Write Python code for the selection sort algorithm to sort an array into ascending order
2. Write Python code for the bubble sort algorithm to sort an array into ascending order, but
with the possibility of an early exit if there are no swaps on some iteration through the outer
loop
3. Polynomial evaluation

# Module 6
Recursive Algorithms
1. Write python code for a recursive algorithm that will calculate the number of digits in the
binary expansion/representation of a positive integer n
2. Write python code for a recursive algorithm that will calculate the sum of the squares of the
positive integers 12 + 22 + 32 + ... + ùëõùëõ 2 when supplied with a positive integer n.

# Module 7
Develop one Python program to perform the Quick Select algorithm and for an array of n elements it should find the k-th smallest element of the array)
